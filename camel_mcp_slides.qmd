## Outline

1. PART I: Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. PART II: MCP Integration in Camel

# PART I: What is MCP, exactly? 

---

## Brief History of Function Calling (1/2)

- **Pre-2023 - When LLMs Lacked Environmental Awareness**:
  - Tool usage implemented via prompt engineering 
  - Support provided at framework level (e.g., LangChain, Camel agents)
  - No native capabilities; relied on parsing unstructured model outputs
- **June 2023 – OpenAI Launches Native Function Calling**:
  - Introduced in GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo
  - Utilized structured JSON outputs to call tools and pass arguments
  - Enabled significantly more reliable and scalable tool integration

---

## Brief History of Function Calling (2/2)

- **Nov 2024 – Anthropic Proposes MCP (Model Context Protocol)**:
  - Formalizes tool interaction using JSON-RPC 2.0 standard
  - Standardizes communication between AI systems and external tools/resources
- **2025 – Industry-Wide Adoption**:
  - OpenAI, DeepMind, and other major players adopt MCP
  - Function calling becomes a core capability for advanced agentic AI systems

## Why MCP? 

The power of standardization:

---

## How Does MCP Work? 

- **MCP Hosts**: Claude Desktop App, Camel agents, and other deployment environments
- **MCP Clients**: Internal protocol engines that handle sending/receiving JSON-RPC messages
- **MCP Servers**: Programs that process incoming messages from clients and return structured responses

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# arxiv_toolkit_server.py
import argparse
import sys
from camel.toolkits import ArxivToolkit

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Run Arxiv Toolkit in MCP server mode.",
        usage=f"python {sys.argv[0]} [--mode MODE]",

    args = parser.parse_args()
    toolkit = ArxivToolkit(timeout=args.timeout)
    # Run the toolkit as an MCP server
    toolkit.mcp.run(args.mode)
```

## MCP Search Toolkits (PR [2278](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/2278))

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
search_toolkit = PulseMCPSearchToolkit()
search_toolkit.search_mcp_servers(
    query="Slack",
    package_registry="npm",  # Only search for servers registered in npm
    top_k=1,
)

  "external_url": null,
  "short_description": "Send messages, manage channels, and access workspace history.",

  "package_download_count": 188989,
  "EXPERIMENTAL_ai_generated_description": "This Slack MCP Server, developed by the Anthropic team, provides a robust interface for language models to interact with Slack workspaces. It enables AI agents to perform a wide range of Slack-specific tasks including listing channels, posting messages, replying to threads, adding reactions, retrieving channel history, and accessing user information. The implementation distinguishes itself by offering comprehensive Slack API integration, making it ideal for AI-driven workplace communication and automation. By leveraging Slack's Bot User OAuth Tokens, it ensures secure and authorized access to workspace data. This tool is particularly powerful for AI assistants designed to enhance team collaboration, automate routine communication tasks, and provide intelligent insights from Slack conversations."

## MCP Search Agents (PR [2222](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/2222))

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

from camel.agents import MCPAgent, MCPRegistryConfig, MCPRegistryType 
smithery_config = MCPRegistryConfig(
  type=MCPRegistryType.SMITHERY, 
  api_key=os.getenv("SMITHERY_API_KEY")
)

# Create MCPAgent with registry configurations
agent = MCPAgent(
  model=model,
  registry_configs=[smithery_config]
)

async with agent:
    response = await agent.astep(message)
    print(f"\nResponse from {message}:")
    print(response.msgs[0].content)
```

## Example 1 (Search)

- message = "What MCP tools can I use for connecting to Gmail?"

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
"""
Response from What MCP tools can I use for connecting to Gmail?:
 I found several MCP tools that can connect to Gmail. Here are the options:
 1. **Google Workspace Server** (@rishipradeep-think41/gsuite-mcp)
    - Manage emails and calendar events through Gmail and Calendar APIs
    - [Configure here](https://smithery.ai/server/@rishipradeep-think41/gsuite-mcp/config)
 2. **VeyraX MCP** (@VeyraX/veyrax-mcp)
    - Connects to 70+ tools including Gmail and Calendar
    - [Configure here](https://smithery.ai/server/@VeyraX/veyrax-mcp/config)
 3. **Google Workspace MCP Server** (google-workspace-server)
    - Interact with Gmail and Calendar APIs
    - [Configure here](https://smithery.ai/server/google-workspace-server/config)
 4. **Headless Gmail Server** (@baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail)
    - Access and send emails through Gmail without local credential setup
    - [Configure here](https://smithery.ai/server/@baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail/config)
 5. **Google Workspace Server** (@rishipradeep-think41/gmail-backupmcp)
    - Another option for managing Gmail and Calendar
 Each of these tools requires configuration before it can be used. You'll need 
 to click on one of the configuration links above to set up the tool with your 
 Gmail credentials. Once you've completed the configuration, let me know which 
 tool you've chosen, and I can help you use it to connect to your Gmail account.
"""
```


## Example 2 (Search + Execution)

- May require configuration on the MCP registry, in this case, Smithery.
- message = "Use Brave MCP search tools to find information about Camel-AI.org."

```{python}

## Agent as MCP (PR [2144](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pull/2144))

Define and Export Your Own Camel Agents!

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# Create a default chat agent - customize as needed
chat_agent = ChatAgent()
chat_agent_description = "A general-purpose assistant that can answer questions and help with various tasks."

reasoning_agent = ChatAgent(
    model=ModelFactory.create(
        model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
        model_type="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
)
reasoning_agent_description = "A specialized assistant focused on logical reasoning and problem-solving."

# Create another agent for searching the web
search_agent = ChatAgent(
    model=ModelFactory.create(
        model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
        model_type="gpt-4o",
    ),
    tools=[FunctionTool(SearchToolkit().search_brave)],
)
search_agent_description = "A research assistant capable of retrieving information from the web."

# Provide a list of agents with names
agents_dict = {
    "general": chat_agent,
    "search": search_agent,
    "reasoning": reasoning_agent,
}

# Provide descriptions for each agent
description_dict = {
    "general": chat_agent_description,
    "search": search_agent_description,
    "reasoning": reasoning_agent_description,
}
```


## Agent as MCP Example - Using Claude Desktop 

- Provide proper configs to Claude:
```{json}
"camel-chat-agent": {
  "command": "/Users/jinx0a/micromamba/bin/python",
  "args": [
    "/Users/jinx0a/Repo/camel/services/agent_mcp_server.py"
  ],
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "...",
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "...",
    "BRAVE_API_KEY": "..."
  }
}
```

- Now let's use Claude to interact with Camel agents!

## Ongoing MCP Developments

- **MCP Search Agents**: Integration with additional MCP registries including Composio
- **MCP Hub**: Hosting and validating our own repository of MCP servers
- **Role-Playing/Workforce as MCP Servers**: Transforming Camel's multi-agent module into MCP servers
